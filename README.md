## üîÑÔ∏è Roll-Back

**If something breaks you can rely on:**

1. A restoration point;
2. The [`repair-windows.ps1`](./src/scripts/repair-windows.ps1) file or button on [`Win10ScriptGUI.ps1`](./Win10ScriptGUI.ps1);
3. If you want (almost) everything to it's original state, use the `Undo Tweaks` button on [`Win10ScriptGUI.ps1`](./Win10ScriptGUI.ps1).

## ‚ùó Usage Requirements

The `Win10Script(CLI/GUI).ps1` do not make everything automatically, follow these steps.

- Extract the `.zip` file.
- Open `OpenTerminalHere.cmd` (For beginners) or the Powershell as admin on it's folder.
- Enable execution of PowerShell scripts and Unblock PowerShell scripts and modules within this directory (Down below).

### **GUI Version**

- Copy and Paste this entire line below on **Powershell**:

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse *.ps*1 | Unblock-File; .\"Win10ScriptGUI.ps1"
```

![Script GUI](./src/assets/script-gui.gif)

_The `Apply Tweaks` button is the main one for debloating._

### **CLI Version** (Minimal, good for automation)

- Copy and Paste this entire line below on **Powershell**:

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse *.ps*1 | Unblock-File; .\"Win10ScriptCLI.ps1"
```

**[Scripts](./src/scripts) can be run individually, pick what you need.**
