## Adapted from [W4RH4WK's Project](https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10)

## Download Latest Version

Code located in the `master` branch is always considered under development,
but you'll probably want the most recent version anyway.

- [Download [zip]](https://github.com/LeDragoX/Win10SmartDebloat/archive/master.zip)

## Resume

This project is a modified version of [another project](https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10)
that was made for *Debloat* and *Tweak* Windows 10 for *better performance* and *less issues*.

## Roll-Back

**There is a undo (if works)**, because i did a restoration point script before
doing everything.

**Use on a fresh windows install to note the differences, and if something breaks,**
**you can rely on a pre-made restoration point and the** [`fix-general-problems.ps1`](./scripts/fix-general-problems.ps1) file.

## Usage Requirements

The `Script-Win10.ps1` do not make everything automatically, follow these steps.

- Open `OpenPowershellHere.cmd` (For beginners) or the Powershell as admin on its folder.
- Enable execution of PowerShell scripts and Unblock PowerShell scripts and modules within this directory.

### Easy way (Prepare and Run once):

- Copy and Paste this entire line below on **Powershell**:
```Powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse .ps1 | Unblock-File; .\"Win10Script.ps1"
```

**[Scripts](/scripts) can be run individually, pick what you need.**

## Script Features

- Make a Restore Point ([`backup-system.ps1`](./scripts/backup-system.ps1))

## How did i find specific Tweaks?
<details>
    <summary>How To (Advanced Users)</summary>

By using [SysInternal Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite) `Procmon(64).exe`
i could track the `SystemSettings.exe` by filtering it per Process Name, then `Clearing the list (Ctrl + X)`
(But make sure it is `Capturing the Events (Ctrl + E)`) and finally, applying an option of the Windows Configurations
and searching the Registry Key inside `Procmon(64).exe`.

![Grab the current tweak on registry with Procmon64.exe](./lib/images/Grab-the-current-tweak-on-registry-with-Procmon64.png)

After finding the right register Key, you just need to Right-Click and select `Jump To... (Ctrl + J)` to get on its directory.
