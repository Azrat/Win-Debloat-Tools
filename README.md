## Resume

This is a improved version from [another project](https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10). 
These scripts will Customize, Debloat and Improve Security/Performance on Windows 10.

## Roll-Back

**There is a undo (if works)**, because i did a restoration point script before
doing everything.

**Use on a fresh windows install to note the differences, and if something breaks,**
**you can rely on a pre-made restoration point and the** [`repair-windows.ps1`](./scripts/repair-windows.ps1) file.

## Usage Requirements

The `Script-Win10.ps1` do not make everything automatically, follow these steps.

- Open `OpenPowershellHere.cmd` (For beginners) or the Powershell as admin on its folder.
- Enable execution of PowerShell scripts and Unblock PowerShell scripts and modules within this directory.

### Easy way (Prepare and Run once):

#### GUI (Advice - Some of the output still missing from the console, not something to worry about, just the % and ETA from some commands)

- Copy and Paste this entire line below on **Powershell**:
```Powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse *.ps*1 | Unblock-File; .\"Win10ScriptGUI.ps1"
```
![Script GUI](./lib/images/Script-GUI.png)
*The `Automated Tweaks` button is the main one.*

#### CLI

- Copy and Paste this entire line below on **Powershell**:
```Powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse *.ps*1 | Unblock-File; .\"Win10Script.ps1"
```

**[Scripts](/scripts) can be run individually, pick what you need.**

## How did i find specific Tweaks?
<details>
    <summary>How To (Advanced Users)</summary>

By using [SysInternal Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite) `Procmon(64).exe`
i could track the `SystemSettings.exe` by filtering it per Process Name, then `Clearing the list (Ctrl + X)`
(But make sure it is `Capturing the Events (Ctrl + E)`) and finally, applying an option of the Windows Configurations
and searching the Registry Key inside `Procmon(64).exe`.

![Grab the current tweak on registry with Procmon64.exe](./lib/images/Grab-the-current-tweak-on-registry-with-Procmon64.png)

After finding the right register Key, you just need to Right-Click and select `Jump To... (Ctrl + J)` to get on its directory.
